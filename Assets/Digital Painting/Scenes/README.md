# Digital Painting Scenes

To create your own scene you should start with the `Starter Template`. Open it 
and save it as a new scene. Then add your terrain and objects to it. Alternatively,
move the objects in the starter scene into your existing scene. For more details see
the [documentation on creating scenes](./Assets/Digital%20Painting/Docs/InterestingThings.md).

  1. Install dependencies (see descriptions below)
  2. Install the plugin just like any other unity package - simply double click the package file. 
  3. Create a configuration file using `Assets -> Create -> Wizards Code/PLUGIN TYPE ... ` There will be entries in this folder for each of the plugins you have installed
  4. Drag the generated configuration file into the `Configuration` field of the `PLUGIN Manager` component attached to the `DigitalPaintingManager` game object
  5. Double click the configuration file and configure as appropriate
  6. Check the README.md in the root of the plugin directory for more information about each specific plugin. It will be called 'Assets/DigitalPainting/Plugin/PLUGINTYPE_PLUGINNAME'

Be aware that any dependencies must be installed first if you want to avoid build errors. Don't worry though, you can install the dependencies afterwards and the errors should be resolved.

# Digital Ruby's Weather Maker

[Digital Ruby's Weather Maker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/weather-maker-sky-weather-water-volumetric-light-60955) doesn't just provide weather effects, it also has a Day Night cycle. At present we only have integration with the Day Night Cycle. Patches are welcome to add weather integrations too.

To use simply drag the `WeatherMakerPrefab` (from the Weather Maker asset) into your scene. If you are only using the Day Night Cycle you can remove all the children except `DayNightCycle` and `LightManager`.

Then follow the instructions for setting up a Day Night Cycle in The Digital Painting.

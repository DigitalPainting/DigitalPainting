# DigitalPainting
A Unity project that provides a "Digital Painting", a scene that is automatically explored by the camera. It provides a frameowork in which digitial art can be created.

## Getting Started

In order to build and test features of the Digital Painting project all developers use the "Dev Scene" to develop new features. This scene uses a standard set of (zero cost) assets from the Unity Asset store and packages from Unity itself. Any features that are dependent on other assets must be optional and must degrade gracefully in this scene when only the assets and packagts listed below are included.

However, just because they are zero cost it doesn't mean that we can distribute them as part of this project. Therefore you will need to download and import the following assets and packaged.

### Required Assets (all zero cost)

Download and import the following assets:

    * [Fantasy Landscape](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy-landscape-103573)

### Required Packages

Install these packages using Window -> Package Manager in Unity.

    * Cinemachine
